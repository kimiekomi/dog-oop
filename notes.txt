OOP - 

Create a dog object...what actions or attributes can a dog have/do

interactive…create multiple dogs

user needs to set/change gender/name…need to ask for name/gender

need timer to determine when hungry/sleepy...import timer
maybe log activities in .txt file

menu when user type “h”

To Do:
- remove will_continue
- change menu input...don't accept numbers...split input use contain()
- add feature to switch dogs or create new dog(s)
- might need separate create_dog() and interact_dog() 
- need display_menu(list)...maybe

Dog
- name
- age
- breed

- eat (every 18 sec)
- sleep (every 36 sec)
- walk (every 12 sec)
