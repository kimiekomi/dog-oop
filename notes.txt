OOP - 

Create a dog object...what actions or attributes can a dog have/do

interactive…create multiple dogs

user needs to set/change gender/name…need to ask for name/gender

need timer to determine when hungry/sleepy...import timer
maybe log activities in .txt file

menu when user type “h”

To Do:
- when call create_dog() again, dog_entries is overwritten
- switch dog not switching in process_activity()...only uses LAST instantiated object
- need to append OBJECT to list
    - change create_dog() line 67, 73, 74
    - change list_dogs() line 88-92
    - change activate_dog()  line 102, 105
    - change select_dog() for loop, line 135-141
    - change all process_activity() if/elif statements

Dog
- name
- age
- breed

- eat (every 18 sec)
- sleep (every 36 sec)
- walk (every 12 sec)
